# 🧠 PUBLIC KEY TO BITCOIN ADDRESSES

**Public Key to Bitcoin Addresses** is a compact and reliable Python utility that converts an uncompressed Bitcoin public key to both compressed and uncompressed Bitcoin addresses using built-in encoding logic.

- ✅ Key compression (`04...` → `02...` / `03...`)
- ✅ Uncompressed and compressed address generation
- ✅ Base58Check output (legacy-compatible)
- ✅ Color-coded output in terminal

---

## ⚙️ Features

- 🔁 Compresses uncompressed public keys
- 🔐 Generates valid Bitcoin addresses (both forms)
- 🖥️ CLI-based interaction via terminal
- 🎨 Visual feedback using `termcolor`

## 🚀 Usage

### Option 1 – via Python:
```bash
python public_key_to_bitcoin_addresses.py
```

### Option 2 – via `.bat` launcher (Windows):
```cmd
public_key_to_bitcoin_addresses.bat
```

- Input: 130-character uncompressed public key (starts with `04`)
- Output:
  - Compressed public key (`02`/`03`)
  - Bitcoin address from uncompressed key
  - Bitcoin address from compressed key
